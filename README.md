**Welcome to my project, where I employ the spaCy library to train a model for entity recognition in text. The primary goal of the project is to identify geographical names and other key entities related to mountains and mountainous landscapes.**

## Training Data Set
For model training, I use a dataset consisting of texts containing information about various mountains worldwide. Each text is accompanied by an annotation containing character indices indicating the start and end of entities in the text.

## Contents of this repository:
- model-best - saved model
- Training_model(NLP)_tokens_with_mountains - a file from Jupiter Notebook in which I form a DataSet and train the model
- Using_Model(NLP tokens)mountains inference - using the stored and trained model - model-best
- annotations.json is the data for training the model in .json format
